# Precision Floating Multiplier
A signed 8-bit (8 bit input and 16 bit output) quarter precision floating multiplier using structural VHDL and a testbench to 
verify the design. Done as part of EE224 IIT Bombay course project.
<br>
The format for the quarter precision representation - SEEEFFFF <br>
where S is the sign bit, E is the normalized exponent and F is the fraction. <hr>
This project does not consider subnormals. Feel free to add that in the implementation.
